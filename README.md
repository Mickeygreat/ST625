# NY real estate group project

* Analyzed the largest real estate market in the U.S.-NY(Kaggle Dataset 2016-2017) to predict the sale price
* Cleaned data and transformed qualitative variables(Borough and Dates) for later process of building multiple linear regression model
* Conducted data analysis with regression techniques, including the use of transformations such as squares and logarithms, the modeling of interactions, and handling problems resulting from heteroscedastic and multicollinearity
* Constructed a multiple linear regression model through brute force and added interaction terms to improve the model for predicting the sale price
